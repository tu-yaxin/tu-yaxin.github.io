<h2>On Modal Substitution Logic</h2>
<ul type="circle">
<li>We are exploring the extension of basic modal logic with an iterative substitution operator. For any monotone function in a complete lattice, one can obtain its least fixed-point by starting with the minimal element, iteratively applying the function to generate an approximation sequence and finding the limit of this sequence. However if we start with an arbitrary element, or the function is not monotone, then the approximation sequence oscillates instead of converge. We study the (iterative) substitution operation, the fundamental operation in generating the approximation sequence. 

We study the property of (iterative) substitution itself, and </li>
