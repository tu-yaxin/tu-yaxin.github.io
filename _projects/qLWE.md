description: <p>We attempted to solve discrete Gaussian sampling (equivalent to standard lattice problems) by first reducing it to a quantum analog of LWE (learning with errors) with special error distribution, and then solving the quantum LWE problem. We closed the first step, leaving the second step open. </p>
