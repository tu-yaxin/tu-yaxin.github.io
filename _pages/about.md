I am a second-year PhD student in the [theory group](https://theory.cs.princeton.edu/) in Princeton University, where I am fortunate to be coadvised by Prof. [Ran Raz](https://engineering.princeton.edu/faculty/ran-raz) and Prof. [Alex Lombardi](https://sites.google.com/view/alex-lombardi/home). I have found and am exploring my interests broadly in TCS, including complexity theory, cryptography, and their interplay. 

Prior to joining Princeton, I graduated from Yao Class at Tsinghua University. During my undergraduate, I was fortunate to be advised by great people. I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Yilei Chen](http://www.chenyilei.net/) at Tsinghua who sparked my interest in cryptography. During 2022 I had an amazing time at Reichman University and NTT Research working with Prof. [Elette Boyle](https://cs.idc.ac.il/~elette/) and Prof. [Yuval Ishai](https://yuvali.cswp.cs.technion.ac.il/).

      The learning with errors problem (LWE) is one of the most important building blocks for post-quantum cryptography. To better understand the quantum hardness of LWE, it is crucial to explore quantum variants of LWE. To this end, Chen, Liu, and Zhandry [Eurocrypt 2022] defined S|LWE⟩ and C|LWE⟩ problems by encoding the error of LWE samples into quantum amplitudes, and showed efficient quantum algorithms for a few interesting amplitudes. However, algorithms or hardness results of the most interesting amplitude, Gaussian, were not addressed before.<br><br>
      In this paper, we show new algorithms, hardness results and applications for S|LWE⟩ and S|LWE⟩ with real Gaussian, Gaussian with linear or quadratic phase terms, and other related amplitudes. Let n be the dimension, q be the modulus of LWE samples. Our main results are<br><br>
      <ol>
      <li>
        There is a 2^{Θ(√(n log q))}-time algorithm for S|LWE⟩ with Gaussian amplitude with known phase, given 2^{Θ(√(n log q))} many quantum samples. The algorithm is modified from Kuperberg's sieve, and in fact works for more general amplitudes as long as the amplitudes and phases are completely known.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is a polynomial time quantum algorithm for solving S|LWE⟩ and C|LWE⟩ for Gaussian with quadratic phase amplitudes, where the sample complexity is as small as Õ(n). As an application, we give a quantum oblivious LWE sampler where the core quantum sampler requires only quasi-linear sample complexity. This improves upon the previous oblivious LWE sampler given by Debris-Alazard, Fallahpour, Stehlé [STOC 2024], whose core quantum sampler requires Õ(nr) sample complexity, where r is the standard deviation of the error.
      </li>
      <li>
        There exist polynomial time quantum reductions from standard LWE or worst-case GapSVP to S|LWE⟩ with Gaussian amplitude with small unknown phase, and arbitrarily many samples. Compared to the first two items, the appearance of the unknown phase term places a barrier in designing efficient quantum algorithm for solving standard LWE via S|LWE⟩.

- **Improved Constructions for Distributed Multi-Point Functions**  \

  IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy 2025 \

      A Distributed Point Function (DPF) is a cryptographic primitive used for compressing additive secret shares of a secret unit vector across two parties. Many DPF applications require compressed shares of a sparse <i>weight-t</i> vector, namely a Distributed Multi-Point Function (DMPF). Despite the strong motivation and prior optimization efforts, in most use cases the best practical implementation of DMPF is still a simple brute-force combination of t independent DPFs. <br><br>
      We present new constructions and optimized implementations of DMPFs in different parameter regimes, providing significant efficiency savings over existing approaches. We showcase our new constructions within applications of pseudorandom correlation generators (PCGs) and 2-server private set intersection (PSI). <br><br>
      Incorporating our tools into the state-of-the-art PCG for “silent” generation of binary multiplication triples (FOLEAGE, Bombar et al, ePrint’24) yields a ×2.68 improvement in throughput, with only ×1.4 blowup in the seed size. On a single core of our benchmark machine, our implementation silently generates up to 22.1 million triples per second, outperforming even the best “non-silent” protocol (Roy, CRYPTO’22), which generates 16 million triples per second.

  We discuss a simple logic to describe one of our favourite games from childhood, hide and seek, and show how a simple addition of an equality constant to describe the winning condition of the seeker makes our logic undecidable. There are certain decidable fragments of first-order logic which behave in a similar fashion with respect to such a language extension, and we add a new modal variant to that class. We discuss the relative expressive power of the proposed logic in comparison to the standard modal counterparts. We prove that the model checking problem for the resulting logic is P-complete. In addition, by exploring the connection with related product logics, we gain more insight towards having a better understanding of the subtleties of the proposed framework.</div>
