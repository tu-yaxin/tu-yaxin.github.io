I am a first-year PhD student in the [theory group](https://theory.cs.princeton.edu/) in Princeton University, where I am fortunate to be coadvised by Prof. Ran Raz and Prof. Alex Lombardi. In 2023 I graduated from Yao Class at Tsinghua University, where I have been advised by Prof. Yilei Chen who sparked my interest in cryptography.  

I have found and am exploring my interests in TCS, including complexity theory, (classcial and quantum) cryptography, and their interplay.
